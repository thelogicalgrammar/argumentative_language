This directory contains the data sets from three experiments:


1. a pilot study (`data_pilot`) used for exploring the space of computational models to use
2. a run (`data_exeperiment1`) with N=80 participants with a single-sized matrix (5 students, 12 questions); this is Experiment 1 in the preregistration
3. a run (`data_exeperiment2`) with N=120 participants a third of which saw one of the three other matrix sizes; this is Experiment 2 in the preregistrion

The file `data-exploration.r` contains R-code to wrangle the data, produce summary statistics and to plot the data.
