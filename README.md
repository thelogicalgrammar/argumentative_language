# Modeling Language Use with Argumentative Goals

This repository contains the code, data, and analysis for a research project investigating the production of quantifiers in argumentative contexts. The project mainly consists of experimental results and Bayesian Data Analysis with a variety of different models.

## Project Structure

- **data/**  
  Contains datasets from three experiments:
  1. A pilot study for model exploration.
  2. Experiment 1: fixed matrix size (5 students × 12 questions).
  3. Experiment 2: variable matrix sizes.
  
  Also includes `data-exploration.r` for data wrangling and plotting.

- **analysis/**  
  Jupyter notebooks and supporting code for modeling and analyzing the experimental data:
  - `analysis_pilot_exp1.ipynb`: Analysis for pilot and Experiment 1.
  - `analysis_exp2.ipynb`: Analysis for Experiment 2.
  - `argstrengths.ipybn`: Visualization and comparison of argstrengths, also vis a vis the data.
  - `tests_and_designs.ipybn`: Various tests, plots, etc., that didn't naturally fit anywhere else.
  - `excluded_models.ipynb`: Models that were considered but didn't make it to the preregistration. This was cleaned up fairly quickly from a previous version, so some things might be slightly broken.
  - `functions/`: Python functions used in the notebooks.
  - `environment.yml`: Conda environment for reproducibility.


- **experiments/**  
  Implementation of the main experiment using [magpie](https://magpie-experiments.org/), a framework for running web-based behavioral experiments.  
  - To run locally:
    1. Install Node.js (v14.x, 16.x, 18.x, or 20.x) and npm (≥7.0.0).
    2. Run `npm install` in this directory.
    3. Use `npm run serve` to start the local server.

- **paper/**  
  The research paper describing the experiments and modeling.

## Installation & Requirements

- **Analysis:**  
  Use the provided `analysis/environment.yml` to create a conda environment:
  ```bash
  conda env create -f analysis/environment.yml
  conda activate argumentative_language
  ```
- **Experiment:**  
  See `experiments/speaker_side/README.md` for details. Requires Node.js and npm.
